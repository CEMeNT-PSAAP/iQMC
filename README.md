# 1DQMC
Author: Sam Pasmann

1DQMC is a hyrbid Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) and deterministic code for neutron transport.
The theory behind the code is outlined in [1]. 1DQM uses Quasi-Monte Carlo 
methods to solve successive iterations of the standard Source Iteration for 
neutron transport. In the future, iterative methods like
Krylov Subspace methods will also be added as the base QMC code allows for 
plug-and-play compatibility with different solvers.
